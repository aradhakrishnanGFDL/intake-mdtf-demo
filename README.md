This repository is used for a simple intake-esm demo to the Model Diagnostics Task Force, for it's potential use in MDTF. 

Try it out

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aradhakrishnanGFDL/intake-mdtf-demo/main)

It can take a minute for the binder to load. It's doing a lot of setup for you. Once it loads, you will see a few directories displayed from the github repo.
From there, navigate to notebooks and open demo-search-explore.ipynb. You can run/play each cell live and see the magic of data catalogs.
